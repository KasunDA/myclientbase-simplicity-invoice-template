##Notes

I am not responsible for any damage to your installation.  
I am not part of the official MyClientBase team.

The mPDF php class is developed by: http://www.mpdf1.com/mpdf and not part of my work.

##Installation

To install, upload the whole folder "application" into the root of your MyClientBase installation.

Login into your MCB installation then and go to "System Settings", Tab "General" and change "PDF Helper" to "mPDF".

Switch to the "Invoices" tab and select "simplicity" under "Default Invoice Template".
